        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
          These ice pops are so good! They're very reminiscent of the strawberry
          shortcake ice cream bars you can buy with the pink and white cookie
          bits on the outside. Feel free to use sugar-free pudding mix. The
          number of pops you get will depend on the size of your molds.

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
          <li>
            Place cookies in blender. Blend on High setting, stopping blender to
            stir occasionally, until cookies become fine crumbs. Reserve.
          </li>
          <li>
            In clean blender, combine strawberries, sugar, and water. Blend on
            High setting until smooth.
          </li>
          <li>
            Combine pudding mix and milk in a large bowl. Beat with whisk until
            thick, about 2 minutes. Stir in cookie crumbs.
          </li>
          <li>
            Fill ice pop molds 1/3 full of pudding mixture. Layer with
            strawberry puree to 2/3 full; top evenly with remaining pudding
            mixture. Place sticks into molds, and freeze overnight. Run molds
            under hot water if difficult to remove pops.
