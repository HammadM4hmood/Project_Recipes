          Place the chocolate chips into a microwave-safe bowl, and microwave on
          Low until the chips barely melt, about 2 minutes. Stir the melted
          chips smooth. Place the sprinkles and chopped walnuts into separate
          shallow bowls.

          Dip each banana half in melted chocolate, then roll in candy sprinkles
          and chopped nuts. Place the coated bananas on waxed paper, and freeze
          until the chocolate hardens, about 5 minutes.
